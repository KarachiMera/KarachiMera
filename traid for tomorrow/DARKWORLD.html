<h1><u>HACKER</u></h1>
<dive>
 <p>A<u> hacker.</u> is an individual who uses their technical expertise to gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks,
or digital devices. While the term "hacker" often carries a negative connotation due to its association with illegal
activities, it can also refer to individuals who use their skills for ethical and constructive purposes. Hackers are
typically proficient in programming, computer systems, and security protocols, and they may employ a range of techniques
to explore or manipulate digital systems.

<h2>Types of Hackers:</p>
 <h3><u>Black Hat Hackers:</u></h3>
 <br>
  These are individuals who engage in illegal activities with malicious intent. Black hat hackers often
exploit security vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information, cause damage, or disrupt operations. Their actions are
criminal and can lead to severe legal consequences.

<h3><u>White Hat Hackers:</u></h3>
<br>
 Known as ethical hackers, white hats use their skills to help organizations strengthen their security
systems. They are often employed by companies or government agencies to identify vulnerabilities in systems and report
them before they can be exploited by malicious hackers.

<h3>Gray Hat Hackers:<h3> 
  <br>
   the gray hat hacker fall in between white and black beacuse they can use their knowlgade 
   to hack or crack any system to prove their self as a master but in a real life they are not even 
   white or black hat hacker it just what they think they are However, their actions can still be illegal depending on the circumstances.

<h3><u>Hacktivists:</u></h3>
<small> Hacktivists use hacking techniques to promote political or social causes. Their goal is typically to disrupt systems or steal data to highlight issues such as government corruption, human rights violations, or
environmental concerns.</small>

<h3><u>Script Kiddies:</u></h3>
<small>are inexperienced hackers who rely on pre-written software tools (scripts) to exploit</small>
vulnerabilities.
<small>They lack the advanced technical skills of more experienced hackers but still cause damage through their actions.</small>

<h2><u>Techniques Used by Hackers:</u></h2>
<u>Phishing:</u>
 A method where hackers impersonate legitimate organizations to steal sensitive data like login credentials or
</h3></u> card information.</u></h3>
Malware: Hackers may use malicious software, such as viruses, trojans, or ransomware, to infect systems, steal data, or
<h3><u> payments.</u></h3>
Social Engineering: Manipulating individuals into revealing confidential information or granting unauthorized access,
<h3><u>through deceptive means.</u></h3>
<h2><u>Denial of Service (DoS):</u><h2>
<br>
 Attacking a network or server to make it unavailable to its intended users, often by
overwhelming it with traffic.
Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities: Finding and exploiting weaknesses in software or hardware systems to gain
<h3><u>unauthorized access or control.</u></h3>
<h2><u>Ethical Hacking:</u></h2>
Ethical hackers, also known as penetration testers or security researchers, are employed to find and fix security
vulnerabilities in a system before malicious hackers can exploit them. They conduct authorized security assessments to improve cybersecurity practices.

<h2><u>Importance of Hackers in Cybersecurity:</u></h2>
<br>
Hackers play a critical role in modern cybersecurity. Ethical hackers identify vulnerabilities, helping to prevent data
breaches, financial losses, and damage to reputations. Their work is integral to the development of secure systems, as
they help organizations understand and mitigate risks.
